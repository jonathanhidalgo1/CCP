# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful and considerate
- Giving and receiving constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Publishing others’ private information without permission

## Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please open a private report by emailing the maintainer listed in the repository’s README or by opening a private advisory if available. If neither exists, open a regular issue and request a private contact channel.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html
