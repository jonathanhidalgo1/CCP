# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This project is early-stage and experimental. Security fixes will be addressed on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please open an issue with the **security** label and request a private contact channel if you need to share sensitive details. If a private channel becomes available, we will move the report there.
