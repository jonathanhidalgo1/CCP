# Contributing to CCP

Thanks for helping improve CCP! This project is early-stage, so feedback and small iterations are especially valuable.

## Ways to contribute
- Report bugs or inconsistencies in the protocol or docs
- Propose improvements to message schemas
- Add examples or adapters
- Improve documentation or translations

## Development setup (examples)
The reference example lives in `examples/ccp_api`.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r examples/ccp_api/requirements.txt
```

## How to submit changes
1. Fork the repo and create a branch: `feat/your-feature` or `fix/your-bug`.
2. Make focused commits with clear messages.
3. Ensure docs/examples still work.
4. Open a pull request with context and rationale.
